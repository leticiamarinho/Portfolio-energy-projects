# Energy Demand Curve Analysis (Brazil)

📈 This project aims to analyze the daily energy demand curve in Brazil using public data from the National Electric System Operator (ONS).

## 🔍 Objective

To identify patterns, peaks, and variations in the energy demand curve throughout the day and across different regions and seasons in Brazil.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- ONS public datasets (CSV format)

## 📊 Key Insights

- Identification of peak hours and demand valleys.
- Weekday vs. weekend consumption patterns.
- Regional load curve comparison.
- Impact of renewable generation on the net load curve (to be expanded).
